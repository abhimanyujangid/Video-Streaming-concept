# Video Streaming Concept

This project demonstrates a video streaming solution using Node.js, Express, and Video.js. The application allows users to upload video files, which are then converted to HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) format using FFmpeg. The converted videos can be streamed via a React frontend using Video.js.

## Features

- **Video Upload:** Upload videos through an Express.js backend.
- **Video Conversion:** Convert uploaded videos to HLS format using FFmpeg.
- **Video Streaming:** Stream the converted videos using Video.js in a React frontend.
- **Responsive Player:** The Video.js player is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:**
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
  - Multer (for handling file uploads)
  - FFmpeg (for video conversion)
  - UUID (for generating unique IDs)

- **Frontend:**
  - React.js
  - Video.js

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+)
- FFmpeg (Ensure FFmpeg is installed and accessible in your system's PATH)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abhimanyujangid/Video-Streaming-concept.git
   cd Video-Streaming-concept
   ```

2. Install the backend dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. Install the frontend dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

#### Backend

1. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

   The backend server will be running on `http://localhost:8000`.

#### Frontend

2. Start the React frontend:

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

   The frontend will be running on `http://localhost:3000` (or `http://localhost:5173` if using Vite).

### Uploading and Streaming Videos

1. Navigate to the frontend in your browser.
2. Upload a video file using the provided interface.
3. The video will be converted to HLS format, and a streaming URL will be generated.
4. The video will be displayed and streamed using the Video.js player.

## Project Structure

- **backend/** - Contains the Express server and video upload/conversion logic.
- **frontend/** - Contains the React application and Video.js integration.
- **uploads/** - Directory where uploaded videos and HLS files are stored.

## Example Video URL

After uploading a video, you can access the streaming URL at:

```
http://localhost:8000/uploads/courses/{lessonId}/index.m3u8
```

Replace `{lessonId}` with the actual lesson ID generated during the upload.

# FFmpeg and Video Segments

## Introduction to FFmpeg

**FFmpeg** is a powerful, open-source software suite used for handling multimedia data, including video, audio, and other streams. It provides tools for converting, streaming, and manipulating multimedia files. FFmpeg supports a wide range of formats, making it an essential tool for developers and multimedia professionals.

### Key Features of FFmpeg

- **Format Support**: FFmpeg supports almost every format of video and audio files, making it highly versatile.
- **Encoding and Decoding**: FFmpeg can encode and decode multimedia files, converting them from one format to another.
- **Streaming**: It allows for real-time audio and video streaming.
- **Filtering**: FFmpeg offers extensive filtering options, enabling users to adjust audio and video properties.
- **Compression**: FFmpeg can compress multimedia files to reduce their size without significant loss of quality.

## Understanding Video Segments

**Video segments** refer to the division of a video file into smaller, more manageable chunks. In the context of video streaming, especially HTTP Live Streaming (HLS), a video file is broken down into multiple segments, typically a few seconds long. These segments are then delivered sequentially to the viewer.

### Benefits of Video Segments

- **Improved Buffering**: Smaller segments allow for smoother playback, as the player can start playing the first segment while the others are still downloading. This reduces the chance of buffering interruptions.
- **Adaptive Streaming**: Segments enable adaptive bitrate streaming. The player can switch between different quality levels of video segments based on the viewer's network conditions, ensuring a consistent viewing experience.
- **Efficient Caching**: Since segments are small and often repeated across sessions, they can be efficiently cached by content delivery networks (CDNs), reducing load times and bandwidth usage.
- **Resilience**: If a segment fails to load, the player can request it again without reloading the entire video, improving reliability.
- **Faster Start Times**: With segmented video files, the viewer can begin watching almost immediately, as the first segment loads quickly.

### Use Case in This Project

In the **Video Streaming Concept** project, FFmpeg is used to convert video files into HLS format by segmenting the video. This approach enhances the streaming experience, allowing for smoother playback, faster start times, and the flexibility to adapt to different network conditions.
