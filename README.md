# Video Streaming Concept

This project demonstrates a video streaming solution using Node.js, Express, and Video.js. The application allows users to upload video files, which are then converted to HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) format using FFmpeg. The converted videos can be streamed via a React frontend using Video.js.

## Features

- **Video Upload:** Upload videos through an Express.js backend.
- **Video Conversion:** Convert uploaded videos to HLS format using FFmpeg.
- **Video Streaming:** Stream the converted videos using Video.js in a React frontend.
- **Responsive Player:** The Video.js player is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:**
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
  - Multer (for handling file uploads)
  - FFmpeg (for video conversion)
  - UUID (for generating unique IDs)

- **Frontend:**
  - React.js
  - Video.js

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+)
- FFmpeg (Ensure FFmpeg is installed and accessible in your system's PATH)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abhimanyujangid/Video-Streaming-concept.git
   cd Video-Streaming-concept
   ```

2. Install the backend dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. Install the frontend dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

#### Backend

1. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

   The backend server will be running on `http://localhost:8000`.

#### Frontend

2. Start the React frontend:

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

   The frontend will be running on `http://localhost:3000` (or `http://localhost:5173` if using Vite).

### Uploading and Streaming Videos

1. Navigate to the frontend in your browser.
2. Upload a video file using the provided interface.
3. The video will be converted to HLS format, and a streaming URL will be generated.
4. The video will be displayed and streamed using the Video.js player.

## Project Structure

- **backend/** - Contains the Express server and video upload/conversion logic.
- **frontend/** - Contains the React application and Video.js integration.
- **uploads/** - Directory where uploaded videos and HLS files are stored.

## Example Video URL

After uploading a video, you can access the streaming URL at:

```
http://localhost:8000/uploads/courses/{lessonId}/index.m3u8
```

Replace `{lessonId}` with the actual lesson ID generated during the upload.
